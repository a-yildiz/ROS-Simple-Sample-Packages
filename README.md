# ROS Samples

This repo has some ROS scripts and other components to get an initial ROS package up-and-running.


## Packages
- `beginner_tutorials`: This comes directly after completing the Beginner Level part of [official ROS tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials). 
- `ogretici_paket`: This is from a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/temelden-gelismise-python-ile-uygulamali-ros-egitimi/) about ROS, in Turkish.


## Misc
- In VS Code, open your workspace folder directory as the root of this repo, which was originally named `catkin_ws` as commonly done in the ROS community.
